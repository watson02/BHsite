                <h2>Thumbscrew</h2>
                <p>This torture device was used on slave ships If a riot or uprising broke out 
                    on the ship, the leader of it would have to put his or her thumbs or fingers 
                    within the device. The device would either have smooth bumps or sharp spikes 
                    on it that would result in a hole being made in the victim's fingers. 
                    The upper part of the device would be screwed down ultimately crushing the 
                    victims fingers and crushing their bones. If the victim is left with their 
                    fingers crushed in this device for so many hours or even days, their fingers 
                    would need to be amputated afterward.</p>
                <p><i>I have seen them agonizing for hours, I believe, for days together, under 
                    the torture of the thumb screws; a dreadful engine, which, if the screw be 
                    turned by an unrelenting hand, can give intolerable anguish.</i> John Newton</p>
