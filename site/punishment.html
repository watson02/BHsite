                         As a tactic to humiliate the one being whipped, if a man, they would be stripped completely naked. If a woman, she would be stripped down 
                         to their waist to keep their modesty but to also humiliate them for the exposure of her breasts.

                        This collar made it extremely difficult for them to sleep, ultimately sending a
