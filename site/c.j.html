                    and also the first within her family to be born free.</p>

                    of her parents dying. This led to her living with Louvenia,

                <h2>Relocate to St. Louis</h2>
                <p>Moses died and Sarah was left to care for their daughter. This led to her 
                    moving to be with her three brothers who were barbers in St. Louis. When 
                    she moved, she worked as a laundress and went to night school. 
                </p>
                <p>Sarahs hair, along with other womens hair at the time, had begun to become 
                    brittle causing them to lose their hair. This was caused by scalp diseases 
                    such as dandruff and poor hygiene.
                </p>
                <p>Sarah started to try out different mixtures she concocted and created a 
                    formula that included sulfur that promotes hair growth. She sold her formula 
                    within Black neighborhoods by going door to door.
