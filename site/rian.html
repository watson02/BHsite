        <div class="Content1"><p>My name is Rian Watson, I am from Pittsburgh, PA and I am a senior at Allegheny College in Meadville, PA majoring 
          in Computer Science and minoring in Black Studies. I created this website for my senior project I chose to create this website because I am 
          interested in web development and/or UI/UX design as a career. Some other projects I have done include a cooking website for a catering business 
          named BoomGrillx and creating my portfolio from scratch</p>
          <p>Outside of academics, I am the president and social media chair of two clubs, (Association for the) Advancement of Black Culture abbreviated as ABC 
            , and Black Girl Magic, abbreviated as BGM. I also was a Summer Orientation Leader for the last two years at the beginning of the fall semesters.</p>

          <p><i>Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.</i>, a quote said by Nelson Mandela. 
            Black history is a susceptible yet crucial and meaningful topic that all students should learn about. But unfortunately, 
            the truth is being withheld from students when learning about Black history and American history. This leads to a big 
            question that this website is answering: What topics within Black history that are not taught in schools? Learning about American 
            history is essential so we can understand the development of American society and why it is the way it is today. But for us 
            to properly and thoroughly learn about American history, we must learn about all parts of American history, including Black history. 
            The motivation behind the project is due to the writer's personal experience, there was a lot left out, not well elaborated on, and 
            repetitiveness when it came to talking about topics involving Black history in school before college. From this, the writer feels like 
            a lot of other students can relate. The objective of the website is to fill in the gaps that the American school system failed to fill.
            Much like other Black history websites such as the <i>Blackpast</i> website, <i>The National Museum of African American History and Culture </i>website, 
            and the <i>Blackfacts </i>website. The project is to be informative, and educational, and help people see Black history in a different light.</p></div>
