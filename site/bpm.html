                <h2>October 15, 1966</h2>
                <h2>The Oakland Chapter of the Black Panther Party</h2>
                <p>Within the Black community, Black people fell victim to disenfranchisement. In response, The Lowndes 
                    County Freedom Organization, also known as The Black Panther Party of Lowndes County Alabama, was 
                    established to bring Black people together to secure their basic rights. One of the biggest rights 
                    they fought for was the right to vote within the South. This led to the creation of the Black Panther 
                    Party for Self Defense also known as, for short, The Black Panther Party. The Chapter in Oakland, 
                    California was developed on October 15, 1966, by two men who were students at Merritt College together, 
                    Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale.</p>
                <img src = "../site/photos/bpmimg/logo.png" style = "display:block; width: 100%" alt="Logo">
                    <p>The Panthers of the Oakland Chapter were meant to legally patrol the police 
                    and put them under surveillance. They did this by arming themselves with weapons and keeping their distance 
                    between themselves and the police. This resulted in fewer police brutality cases. In response, the FBI viewed 
                    the Party as their enemy and wanted them to shut down. As stated by Huey P. Newton, <i>a black panther is an animal 
                    who will not attack. If attacked, the black panther backs up until he has no more room to back. Then, the black 
                    panther will strike out at his assailant and wipe him out</i>. This is why both parties in California and Alabama 
                    decided to take on a Black Panther as their symbol.</p>

                <h2>Survival Program: Free Breakfast Program</h2>
                <p>The first survival program created was the Free Breakfast for School Children Program. The purpose of This program was to offer free healthy breakfast for 
                    all children that attend the program. The breakfast meals a day would consist of grits, bacon, scrambled eggs, toast and jelly, ham, hot chocolate, sausage, 
                    fresh toast, pancakes, and fruit. Their goal was to expand this program to provide free hot and ready breakfast for hundreds, even thousands of children nationwide 
                    they were successful in this goal by 1969 while also influencing other groups and organizations to create programs. Programs such as the free food program, the food 
                    cooperative program, and nutrition classes.</p>
                    <p>To run such a program, there were a few requirements that must be met, one requirement was that they must have a location to host the program suitable for at least 
                        50 people, as well as table and chairs for those 50 children as well as chairs for children that have to wait before eating, and it must include a kitchen. 
                        The kitchen selected must have 4 burners as well as an oven, large pots, pans, and serving utensils. In addition, they must provide cups, plates, napkins, knives, 
                        spoons, forks, paper, or plastic for the attendees. Because of the demand for space as such, they would host the program in churches or recreation centers.</p>

                    <p>Norma Mtume was born in 1949 in San Diego, CA. But she had moved when she was about four years old to South Central Los Angeles. She attended college at California State 
                        University in Los Angeles and became involved with the BSU, Black Student Union, which is also where she met her husband, Albert Armour. Norma then joined the Black Panther 
                        Party in 1969 when her husbands office was raided by the police, he was beaten, sent to the hospital, and sent to jail. She started working in the breakfast program, then 
                        started typing for Officer of the Day, and then she ran the health clinic here as coordinator / Director in L.A. She left the party in 1977 because she was expelled by Huey. 
                        He had her leave because when he returned from Cuba after fleeing there for three years to escape being tried for assault and multiple murders, he learned that there was a 
                        witness to one of his crimes. He sent out members to murder her but they were not successful, As a result of this, this led to Mtume had her home raided by the police sent to jail, 
                        and was kicked out of the party by Newton. She believes that instead of using the Partys resources to help her fight her case, he kicked her out so that he could use them to fight his.</p>

                <h2>Survival Program: Child Development Center</h2>
                <p> Due to racism within America, there was little to no study of the development of Black children 
                    within their <q>pre-school age</q> and younger and Black children in communal lifestyles. The Black 
                    Panther Party created this program to observe and evaluate children in their early stages of development, 
                    from birth to age one and age one to 2 and a half years old. They did this by making a development schedule that included 
                    motor skills, adaptive (problem-solving), verbalization, self-awareness, and responsiveness. 
                    They split the different skills to be observed into four lesson plan groups by age in which group 
                    one was more of a transition period while the children get used to the so-called <q>toddlers
                    schedule</q>  and different activities, once they have they will move to the next group. Group two 
                    consisted of sensorimotor skills, space and direction, basic body movement, rhythm, and fine muscle 
                    development. Group three consisted of sensorimotor skills, people health, political education, 
                    and practice which teaches them about cleaning up and putting on and taking off clothing and shoes. 
                    Group four is the last and consists of primary skills, physical education, political education 
                    within personal hygiene, political education, practice within making beds, table setting and grocery 
                    shopping, and lastly vocalization.</p>

                <h2>Survival Program: Sickle cell Anemia Research Foundation</h2>
                <p>The Black Panther Party created multiple clinics for the Black community who were not able to have access to or afford to go to one to check on 
                    their health or get treatment. They did this because the United States Government would not due to racism. It was not a priority to the Government 
                    and as a result of this, they raised less than $100,000 in funding. The Sickle-Cell Anemia Research Foundation is one of the programs developed by 
                    the Black Panther Party. Sickle cell is a rare blood disease found mostly in African Americans in which red blood cells form into a sickle shape and 
                    its cells die early, leaving a shortage of healthy red blood cells that can block blood flow causing pain, infection, or death. Within the United States, 
                    it is the most common genetic disease. The program was formed in 1971 and its purpose was to educate people about the disease and gather doctors to test 
                    citizens, study it, and find treatments and cures. The talk of Sickle-Cell Anemia grew when John Lennon and Yoko Ono invited Black Panther member, Bobby 
                    Seale, to talk on his talk show, The Mike Douglas Show, which was popular at the time.</p>
