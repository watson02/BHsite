              <p>Emmett, Wheeler, and a group of teenagers had spent the afternoon working. 
                So they decided to stop by a market store called <i>Bryant's Grocery and Meat Market</i>. 
                The store was owned by a white couple, Roy and Carolyn Bryant, in which Carolyn was working 
                the counter that day.

              <p>Emmett had gone into the store alone to buy some gum while everyone was 
                waiting outside. No one is truly sure what took place between Carolyn and 
                Emmett. Some say he whistled at her, touched her hand, or either was flirting 
                with her in some kind of way.

                <h2>Last Night</h2>
                <p>Around 2:30 am, Roy Brant and his half-brother J.W. Milam came by Moses Wrights 
                  home with a gun and flashlight; they demanded to know where Emmett was and then 
                  dragged him out of his bed. There was someone with the two men who participated in 
                  this kidnapping who had stayed in the car but their identity is not known. 
                  This third person is suspected to be Carolyn because they identify and confirm to 
                  Roy and J.W. that they had Emmett before driving off with him. Later that day Moses 
                  reported Tills kidnapping to authorities.
                </p>

                <p>The two men had beaten Till so badly that it was difficult to recognize him. 
                  They gouged out his eyes, knocked out his teeth, cut off his tongue, and shot him in the head. 
                  After torturing him, they took him to the bank of the Tallahatchie River where they tied one end 
                  of barbed wire to Emmetts neck and the other to a 70-pound cotton gin fan. Lastly, they dumped 
                  his body into the river.

                <h2>A Found Body</h2>
                <p>Two boys who had gone fishing found Emmetts body and reported it. Authorities then went and retrieved 
                   Emmetts body but because he was beaten so badly, it was difficult to tell who he was. Moses was called 
                   to identify the body but it was difficult for him also. He then confirmed that the body was Emmetts when 
                   he saw that the ring he was wearing was Emmetts father's because of the initials engraved on it.

                <p>After the sheriff had seen Emmetts body, he insisted that the body be buried immediately and plans were made. 
                  Emmetts body was going to be prepared at <i>Tutwiler Funeral Home</i> and buried in Money, Mississippi at the 
                  <i>Church of God in Christ Cemetery</i>. These plans were ended when Mamie Till, Emmetts mother was contacted 
                  because she wanted him to be buried in Chicago.
